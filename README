3: 	D:\Git\CodeAcademyAngular>git add .
	warning: You ran 'git add' with neither '-A (--all)' or '--ignore-removal',
	whose behaviour will change in Git 2.0 with respect to paths you removed.
	Paths like 'AngularOnCodeAcademy' that are
	removed from your working tree are ignored with this version of Git.

	* 'git add --ignore-removal <pathspec>', which is the current default,
	  ignores paths you removed from your working tree.

	* 'git add --all <pathspec>' will let you also record the removals.

	Run 'git status' to check the paths you removed from your working tree.
